### note from Sushma Anand Akoju (she/her/hers)

I **did NOT** give any consent to anyone to use my name and my works for any promotion, for any competitive advantages, for commercial use, for professional gains and for any monetary proposals before and now. I **have not** been part of a grant or funding since September 25th 2024. I **did not** have any for-profit or explicit agreements for promotion before and now. I **did NOT** apply for full time jobs as I am pursuing my PhD at the moment and I would consider applying for a different type of jobs closer to my graduation, thanks!!

I have very limited social network presence. Therefore many people do not know that I am taken. **If I did not tell you who my partner is, then anyone else  claiming about being in relationship with me is Interpersonal Violence (IPV) and would fall under coercion.** Recently there seems to be an increase in misuse of advanced technology such as sockpuppeting for circumventing restrictions (to gain access to information not disclosed to the specific individual), impersonation, falsification, IP infringement, so on. <b>Prebunking</b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13843?">Misuse taxonomy</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/mapping-the-misuse-of-generative-ai/">categories of misuse</a>. 

The consequences of misuse of advanced technology/AI could lead to misappropriation of name/electronic media, misdirected moral outrage as a shortcut to bypass competition/legal restrictions, false promotion/hype, presenting false dichotomies, misuse of AI/misuse of organizational anonymous reporting tools for deception, spreading misinformation/false allegations and so on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality">out of crab mentality</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/disclaimer/readme.md">causes</a>). If a person has limited social network presence, then someone who tries to gain access to that person's restricted information, will have to be from stalking/cyberstalking. It would only be a matter of time, such attempts of misuse of technology/stalking eventually comes out. 

We cannot afford to punish targeted individuals of whom the false information was perpetrated. 

Asking victims of whom misinformation was spread i.e. targeted individuals to prove perpetrated allegations were false, parallels exact same experience as punishment for a mistake not committed by them. **Don't fall prey to false information. Protect yourself. Be smart!!** This is just for **prebunking** the misuse of technology.

If you need or require any information about aforementioned note, we are happy to help you arrange a meeting with confidential resources.
